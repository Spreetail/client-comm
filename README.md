client-comm
====================

A library to communicate between client side tabs on a master-slave basis.

Development
-----------

Before developing be sure to have the following installed:
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Bower](ower.io)

Then pull down dependencies by running the following commands:
```
npm install
```
```
bower install
```

Running
-------

To run everything in a simulated environment instead of directly off the file system navigate to the root folder of the project and run:
```
http-server .
```
From there your demos will be served at localhost:8080/examples/[example_name]
